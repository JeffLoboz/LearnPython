# Keywords & Identifiers

## Python Keywords:
- Keywords are reserved words in Python.
- 33 keywords (Python 3.7)
- All keywords except **True**, **False**, and **None** are in lowercase.

      False	  await   	else	    import	  pass
      None	  break 	  except	  in      	raise
      True  	class	    finally	  is	      return
      and	    continue	for	      lambda  	try
      as    	def	      from	    nonlocal	while
      assert	del	      global	  not	      with
      async 	elif	    if	      or	      yield


## Python Identifiers
- A name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc.

### Rules for writing identifiers
1. Can be a combo of letters in lower case **a - z** or uppercase **A - Z** or digits **0-9**, or an underscore **_**.
   - Names like *myClass*, *var_1*, *print_this_to_screen* are all valid.
2. An identifier cannot start with a digit.
   - *1variable* is invalid, but *variable1* is valid. 
3. Keywords can't be used as identifiers.
   - global = 1
4. Can't use special symbols like **!, @, #, $, %, etc.
   - a@ = 0
5. An identifier can be of any length. 


## Remember
- Python is case-sensitive. 
- **Variable** & **variable** are different.
